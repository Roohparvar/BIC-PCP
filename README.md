# BIC-PC  

BIC-PC is a server designed to calculate the physical and chemical properties of a given protein sequence.  
Protein sequences are composed of building blocks called amino acids, and this tool analyzes their characteristics.  

## Features  
- Accepts multiple protein sequences as input in FASTA format.  
- Provides an option to upload a file containing protein sequences.  
- Calculates various physical and chemical properties of the input sequences.  
- Calculates the length of each protein sequence.  
- Determines the frequency and percentage of each amino acid in a protein sequence.  
- Computes the molecular weight of each protein sequence.  
- Useful in fields like protein design, vaccine development, and bioinformatics research.  

## Implementation  
The server is developed using PHP.  

## Future Enhancements  
Additional features and functionalities will be added in future updates to extend the capabilities of the server.
