BIC-PC is a server designed to calculate the physical and chemical properties of a given protein sequence.  
Protein sequences are composed of building blocks called amino acids, and this tool analyzes their characteristics.  

## Features  
- Accepts multiple protein sequences as input in FASTA format.
- Provides an option to upload a file containing protein sequences.
- Calculates various physical and chemical properties of the input sequences.
- Useful in fields like protein design, vaccine development, and bioinformatics research.


## Implementation  
The server is developed using PHP.
